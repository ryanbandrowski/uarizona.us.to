The files included, represent a total of 11 structures The files included, represent a total of eleven (11) structures that are part of the West University neighborhood.

Ideally, this project will feature more than just one Tucson neighborhood. With more than one neighborhood, our plan was the following:

Rotate a different featured neighborhood every time a user opens up the homepage.

Based on the neighborhood displaying at the homepage, inside a sidebar, show a location map of the neighborhood, and optionally offer the opportunity to not only look at historic buildings,
but also eating and hospitality options at that specific neighborhood. This sidebar should also offer a link to a list of other neighborhoods with historic buildings.

Below the featured neighborhood and its sidebar, a section named Near Sites will display three (3) different buildings that belong to the featured neighborhood.
If a neighborhood has more than three (3) historic buildings, this section should display them randomly.

Once inside the inner page of a neighborhood, it will display information and images about it. Inside a sidebar, a list of all its historic buildings and the option for the user to perform a search.

Every historic building will have its own inner page with information and images about it, and a link to its map location. This link could eventually be replaced with an embedded location map similar
to the one displaying in the homepage.

index-edit.html is the file where the interaction with the database was being tested.
