Site: Overlock House
Description: This 1906 bungalow was built by the prominent businessman and engineer John Gardiner. Mr. Gardiner developed numerous homes along third street, known as Gardiner's Terrace. In 1909 President Taft appointed Charles Overlock (founder and first mayor of Douglas, AZ.) to the office of U.S. Marshall for the Territory of Arizona. Mr. Overlock lived here until 1912 when the power of politics decided the job should go to someone else. Overlock balked at leaving, so he was handed his walking papers by Judge Sawtelle, a neighbor who lived a block away. From 1923-1928 the house was owned by Edward Sporleder, who ran a large wholesale grocery. In 1978 restoration was begun by Don Gardiner, and since 1982 has been continued by Judy and Jack Redekop.
Statement of Significance: Significant because it was constructed during the territorial era. Home of Arizona pioneer Charles Alton Overlock. He founded Douglass, Arizona and became that town's first mayor. In 1909 he was appointed U.S. Marshall for the Territory of Arizona and moved to Tucson. He retained that office until 1914 when Judge Sawtelle (who lived just up the street, had him ousted. At that time, he returned to Douglas.
Physical Description: Excellent example of the Territorial Bungalow style typical in the West University Neighborhood with its generous porch and wide eaves, it provides a shady cool place to sit and watch the street. Its raised foundation, made of lava rock from the local westside mountains, provides a way for cool air to circulate under the house. It's one story with brick load-bearing walls, a white stucco surface, a pyramid roof of green asphalt shingles, three chimneys, and in good condition with little changed.
