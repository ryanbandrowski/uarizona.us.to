Description: Built in 1905 in the architectural Mission Revival style, this pretty pink house with its wrap-around porch and handsome arched windows is one story. It is the childhood home of author Rosemary Drachman Taylor, who wrote Chicken Every Sunday in 1943. Later it was turned into a Broadway play and a movie. The story told the story of this important Tucson family and the home, which served as a boarding house, was its main setting. Taylor's second book, “Ridin' the Rainbow”, also a best-seller, was about her father but focused more on his business dealings in early Tucson. The working title of the novel was “The Town's Coming This Way”, which was an expression her father used whenever he brought a large tract of undeveloped property. A prominent real estate developer, Drachman was also the clerk of the U.S. District Court in 1916, and a founder and President of Arizona Bank from 1917-1918.
Statement of Significance: Significant because it was constructed during the territorial era. Childhood home of Author Rosemary Drachman Taylor. Her father Mose Drachman was clerk of the U.S. District Court in 1917, President of Arizona Bank 1917-1918, and founded New Method Laundry (later Oliver's Cleaners), which is still operated by the Drachman family. Prominent Tucsonans.
