Site: Fridena House
Description: It was 1902 and the area had few homes when this American Victorian with Greek revival influences was built. Unusual features include post and beam frame construction, wide eaves articulated with large, scrolled brackets, and interior woodwork of redwood (painted). Its' first owners were Jacob and Mary Neil, bookkeepers for the Tucson Stables, just down the block on 6th Ave. James Clancy, an engineer for Southern Pacific, and his wife Florence, a public-school teacher, lived here from 1904-1929. In 1939 the late Dr. Thomas Fridena, a chiropractor, purchased the home. According to Dr. Adelaide Fridena who survives her husband, the home served as unofficial headquarters for the Tucson Democratic party during the 1960s when Thomas served in the state legislature. Dr. Fridena is noted for having introduced the first Civil Rights bill into the state legislature. In 1983 the house was purchased by DeeDee Samet and is being used for a law office.
