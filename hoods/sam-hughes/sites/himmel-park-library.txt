Site: Himmel Park Library
Description: Himmel Park Library is right in the middle of Sam Hughes thriving with the children of the neighborhood and holding monthly activities alongside Himmel Park. With little changes made to the building it has kept its home-like feel while still adapting to change over the decades. Preserving the surrounding wildlife and adding to the environment with handmade bike racks, benches with hand-painted tiles, new plants and art that do not take away from the building itself has been a big part to adding subtle changes that keep their community growing and making visitors into regulars.
Statement of Significance: Opened in June 1961 as the first branch library located in the City of Tucson.
Physical Description: Small library building made mostly of brick with a home-like feel.
