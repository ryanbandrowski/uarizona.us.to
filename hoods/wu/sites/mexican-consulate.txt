Site: Mexican Consulate
Description: The design of this hip and gable-roofed, beige stucco-surfaced California Bungalow house is attributed to Henry Jaastad, a prominent Tucson architect and later the city's mayor. Built in 1921, this building was for twelve years the home of Enrique Anaya, a noted lawyer, and the first Mexican consul to Tucson. During Anaya's tenure as consul, the house served as both his residence and Mexican Consulate. Anaya sold the house in 1933, and five years later his daughter Eva and her husband Gregorio Nabivitch, a Russian ballet dancer returned and briefly lived here. The house has at various times been the residence of Ernest Ewing the noted mining engineer, the district council headquarters for the Girl Scouts, and a residence hall for the YWCA. In the mid-1970s the property again changed hands and interior renovation and modernization work began by Sylvia and Mike Chihak.
Statement of Significance: One of a collection of bungalows in the area. Architectural design attributed to H. O. Jaastad.
Physical Description: Two stories with a concrete foundation, brick load-bearing walls, a beige stucco surface, and a hip and gable roof with asphalt shingles with little change in good condition.
