Site: Johnson House
Description: Built in 1928, this house was a wedding gift of J.M. Ronstadt (144 Fast University Blvd) to his daughter Margarette and her husband H.D. Smith. Mr. Smith was president of the Frozen Pure Ice Cream Co. on 4th Ave. In 1937 he was appointed to head the Social Security office, thus necessitating a move to Phoenix. Mrs. Smith insisted on selling the house only to their best friends, Mr. and Mrs. Johnny Johnson. Mr. Johnson was chief deputy county recorder for many years. The Johnsons lived here for over forty years. The current owners have been blessed with an old house in need of a few repairs. This Spanish Colonial Revival house has a concrete foundation and concrete block walls. Note the design of the front door. The ring and cross was the traditional symbol of a wedding gift.
Statement of Significance: Contributing to the character of the historic district.
Physical Description: This territorial home is modest compared to the many large homes surrounding it. The Spanish colonial revival architecture is also rare in the neighborhood. It's one story with a concrete foundation, concrete block walls, a tan stucco surface, a flat roof with parapet, a prepared roofing roll, tile over hand over porch, and one chimney, with little change in good condition.
