Site: Bayless House
Description: In 1903 William Bayless, owner of the Carlink Ranch near Reddington, and his two sons Charles and John Stuart built this elegant residence considered one of the show places of Tucson in its day and one of the oldest homes in the neighborhood. Three men and John's wife Elisabeth lived there for the rest of their lives. Al Charles was in the banking business and served on the Arizona Board of Regents and as president of the Tucson Chamber of Commerce. J.S. watched over the family's reaching interest and was the founder of Trinity Presbyterian Church and the Tucson YMCA. Their only child Margaret married Kingston J. Pedro. The Mission-style building was designed by Trost and Trost architects and remains largely unchanged from the original. The walls are built of malapai rock and brick sixteen inches thick. The large basement contains five rooms where the Bayless family moved for comfort during the hot summers.
Statement of Significance: Significant because it was constructed during the territorial era. One of a significant collection of Mission Revival residences. Architecturally significant. Designed by Trost & Trost. Construction was overseen by the firm's local representative R. E. Rust. H. O. Jaastad was a carpenter on the project.
Physical Description: One story with 5 rooms, brick walls, tan stucco, a stone foundation, a full English type basement, a hip and gable roof with mission style sides, a red tile roof cover, four arch front porches glassed in, excellent condition with little changes.
