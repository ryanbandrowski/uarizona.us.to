Statement of Significance: The Tucson Y.W.C.A. is a fine example of Spanish Colonial architecture with Moorish details. The original portion of the building, built in 1930, was designed by Anne Grahm Rockfeller who was with the architectural firm of H.O. Jaastad. Ms. Rockfeller was the initial contact between the firm and the Tucson Y.W.C.A. Through subsequent contacts, she programmed the space needs for the facility. Mr. Jaastad, in addition to being a prominent architect, was active in community affairs. He served as Councilperson between 1925-1933 and later as Mayor of Tucson. His firm, which by then was in partnership with Frederick 0. Knipe, did the 1956 addition of the gymnasium and additional residences. The executive wing addition of 1969 was done after Mr. Jaastad's death by F. O. Knipe's firm.
Physical Description: The Tucson Y.W.C.A. is a one- and two-story Spanish Colonial Revival style structure with Pueblo influences. The complex houses diverse functions such as administration, childcare, classes, residences, lunch programs, and physical recreation facilities including a swimming pool. The complex is basically "L" shaped, extending over a block area. The 1930 and 1956 portions of the building are two-storied stucco on brick while the 1969 addition is one-story stucco on concrete masonry units. The basic complex has a flat roof with a parapet. Portions of the roof that are hipped or shed have mission tile. The west and north entrances have concrete detailing reflecting Spanish Colonial influence. This influence is further reinforced by the use of Mexican tile and decorative wrought iron grillwork.
